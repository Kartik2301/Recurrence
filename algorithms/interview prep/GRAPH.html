DFS Depth First Search
Use Cases: Useful when traversing the graph matters more than traversing in a particular order.

 Time Complexity (BFS / DFS): O(V+E)
  
  Brief derivation: BFS will be called for all the vertices so O(V)
    
    => For each vertice we'll explore it's neighbors 
    
    TC: O(V) + O(x1) + O(X2) + ... + O(Xv)
      = O(V) + O(2E) : for undirected graph, as the edges are undirected so u -> v and v -> u are treated separately, hence the inner loop will run double the times
      = O(V) + O(E) for directed graph

Toplogical Sort [DFS / BFS (Kahn's algorithm)]
Use Cases: Detect cycle in a graph, Find shortest distances in a DAG (single source shortest path algorithm), Count number of paths to a node in a DAG

3. Shortest Path in Directed Acyclic Weighted Graph: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/shortest-path-in-undirected-graph/1
4. Count number of paths to a node in a DAG https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1681 - If the graph is a unweighted DAG we can calculate the all the ways to reach a node (or number of paths using the Toplogical sort algorithm).

Shortest Paths
**Shortest path in unweighted [directed / undirected] graph - BFS**

1. Print Shortest path - https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1667
2. Count Number of shortest paths: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-shortest-paths-unweighted-directed-graph/](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc211/tasks/abc211_d
3. Print all paths: Recurssion / Backtracking
4. If the graph is DAG, then we an use toplogical sort to find the number of paths to each node.

**Shortest path in weighted DAG - Topological Sort**
