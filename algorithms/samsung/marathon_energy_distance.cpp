Marathon Problem

 Energy distance problem.


Question: There was given total physical energy H and total distance D. Five pace information
speed and corresponding physical energy was given. Find the minimum time that is required in order to
complete total distance D making sure that some of the physical energy does not exceed H
( I donâ€™t remember the question exactly, but it is something like this).

Time Limit: 3 secs

I solved using dynamic programming.

Physical Energy Problem

There was given total physical energy H and total distance D. Five pace information speed and corresponding physical energy was given.
Find the minimum time that is
required in order to complete total distance D making sure that some of the physical energy does not exceed H.
